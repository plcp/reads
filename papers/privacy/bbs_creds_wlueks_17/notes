p28 - 2.7.1

    The "e" term within the exponent is here to prevent combination of
    signatures (as the exponent used will be randomized and thus you won't
    be able to "merge" things).

    As "e" remains hidden, we need to prove that we know it. We do that with
    by proving that "1 = (g1)^(e*r1) * (g2)^(e*r2) * (C2)^(-e)" (where 1 is the
    implicit value we commit to).
